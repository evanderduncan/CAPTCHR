# CAPTCHR

first page/html to go to is '/desktop/desktop.html' which takes you to the fake 'desktop'.

as before, I recommend chrome as the phrase library doesn't work in safari. 

also, havent done it yet but the read me text icon is going to load some instructions for the browser search.

when you search with the fake google browser, search for 'captchr' or 'CAPTCHR' to continue to the search result page.

From there you'll be able to access the captchr website and experience the different captchas
